# SymPy Tutorial

Goal: Use SymPy to perform the Euler–Lagrange equation to find the equation of motion for a pendulum

## Instructions

1. Install SymPy:
```bash
pip install sympy
```
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 
cd Project4
```
3. Fill in code to solve problem:

```bash
code pendulum_problem.py
```

* If you need to refernence demo code:
```bash
code demo.py
```
